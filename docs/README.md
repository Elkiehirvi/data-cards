## Presets

Choose from multiple presets to display your data:

### Grid Preset (Default)

The default layout with a balanced design suitable for various use cases. It arranges cards in a grid with 3 columns by default.

### Portrait Preset

Optimized for displaying book covers and portrait images. It features taller cards and uses "contain" fit to display full images without cropping.

### Square Preset

Ideal for photo collections and other visual content. It displays cards in a 1:1 square format, emphasizing the images, with properties shown as an overlay on mouse hover.

### Compact Preset

This preset offers a side-by-side image and content layout, featuring 4 columns by default, with the image on the left and scrollable content on the right, making it ideal when you need to see both the image and details at a glance.

### Dense Preset

This preset maximizes information density with minimal spacing, featuring 6 columns by default, smaller text, and reduced spacing, making it ideal for dashboards and when you need to see many items at once.
