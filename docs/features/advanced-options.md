DataCards offers several advanced options for further customization and optimization.

## Performance Settings

### Lazy Loading

Enable lazy loading to improve performance with many images:

```
enableLazyLoading: true
```

When enabled:
- Images only load when they become visible in the viewport
- Reduces initial load time and saves bandwidth
- Shows a placeholder until the image is loaded
- Provides a smooth fade-in animation when images appear

## Card Appearance

### Card Spacing

Control the space between cards:

```
cardSpacing: 16
```

Value is in pixels, with a range of 0-32.

### Card Shadows

Enable or disable subtle shadows on cards:

```
enableShadows: false
```

### Clickable Cards

Make the entire card clickable to open the note:

```
enableClickableCards: true
```

When enabled, clicking anywhere on the card will open the note, not just the title.

## Creating Custom Card Types (Advanced)

You can create custom card types by combining settings. For example, to create a "magazine" style:

```markdown
```datacards
TABLE title, excerpt, author, cover FROM #articles
SORT date DESC

// Settings
preset: compact
imageHeight: 250px
fontSize: large
propertiesAlign: left
scrollableProperties: true
contentHeight: 300px
```
```

## Using with DataviewJS (Experimental)

While DataCards is designed for standard Dataview queries, not DataviewJS, you can use them together with this approach:

```javascript
```dataviewjs
// Create a datacards block as a string
dv.paragraph("```datacards\nTABLE file.link as \"Title\", author, genre, cover FROM #book\nSORT file.ctime DESC\n\n// Settings\npreset: grid\ncolumns: 3\nimageProperty: cover\n```");
```
```

This uses DataviewJS to generate a DataCards block in the output.

### Advanced DataviewJS Integration Example

For more complex integration, you can combine statistics with visual displays:

```javascript
```dataviewjs
// Get all books
const books = dv.pages("#book")
    .sort(b => b.publication, 'desc');

// Display some stats
const totalBooks = books.length;
const uniqueAuthors = new Set(books.map(b => b.author)).size;

// Output stats
dv.paragraph(`ðŸ“š **Total Books**: ${totalBooks}`);
dv.paragraph(`ðŸ‘¥ **Unique Authors**: ${uniqueAuthors}`);

// Generate a DataCards block for the most recent books
dv.paragraph("### Recent Books\n");
dv.paragraph(`\`\`\`datacards
TABLE file.link as "Title", author, publication, genre, cover FROM #book
SORT publication DESC
LIMIT 6

// Settings
preset: portrait
columns: 3
imageProperty: cover
properties: [file.link, author, publication, genre]
\`\`\``);
```
```

## Debug Mode

If you encounter issues, you can enable debug mode in the plugin settings to help troubleshoot:

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to DataCards plugin settings
3. Enable "Debug Mode" under Developer Settings

This will output detailed logging information to the developer console (Help â†’ Developer â†’ Toggle Developer Tools).
